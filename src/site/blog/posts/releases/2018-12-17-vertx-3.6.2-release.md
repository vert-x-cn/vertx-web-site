We have just released Vert.x 3.6.2, a bug fix release of Vert.x 3.6.x.

There is already a 3.6.1 release but that exhibited a (Maven dependency) regression for Vert.x RxJava, so we reacted immediately and
did a 3.6.2 release to fix the issue, as RxJava is a critical component of the Vert.x stack. Therefore 3.6.2 is instead
announced.

Since the release of Vert.x 3.6.0, quite a few bugs have been reported. We would like to thank you all for reporting these issues.

As you might know, the development of Vert.x 4 has started and therefore a few API will be deprecated in Vert.x 3.

Such APIs will be deprecated step by step in Vert.x 3 with an alternative API so you can anticipate the API upgrade
in Vert.x 4 from the Vert.x 3.6, for 3.6.2 here is the list of deprecations you can find
